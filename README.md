* **RÃ¶ssler Attractor** (A classic chaotic system with a unique shape.)
* **Multistability** (Watch a system jump between two stable states.)
* **Critical Transition** (A 'tipping point'.)
* **Hysteresis** (A system's state depends on its history.)
* **Critical Slowing Down** (Early warning signals for tipping points.)
* **Emergence** (Complex patterns from simple rules.)
* **Self-Organization** (How independent oscillators spontaneously sync)
* **Self-Organized Criticality** (Sandpile avalanches to see power laws.)
* **Scale-Free Networks** (The 'rich get richer.')
* **Ising Model** (A simple model of magnetism and phase transitions.)
* **Shannon Entropy** (Uncertainty in a system.)
* **Multiscale Dynamics** (Interaction of fast and slow variables.)
